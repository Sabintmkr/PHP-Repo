ASSIGNMENT 2 updates that were done for assignment are as follows:
1.install.php file is created at the beginning which is to be implemented first by running the file in the server which automatically creates a database called GameLand.db

2.Along with creation of database the data are populated in the database for the testing pupose. For login the username: Admin and password: www which can be vistied going on the sign-in button in index.php and 
selecting login that will redirect to login.php.

3.libcommon.php is created where most of the common functions that are required for the CRUD operations are written respectively. It is like the base controller in this application.

4.The major change is the application is now dynamic with the implementation of database used and most of the features are populated using database.

5.About-Us and a playstation page is created to show how the page works in nav-bar in the index page where the playstation.php from dropdown shows how the products in the application are displayed accordingly so that the customers
are able to see the products clearly and can decide what they want. 

6.Dashboard the backend portal of the Gameland store is also created which acts as a CMS site where only the authorized users are able to access and use it.
7.The dashboard area is the area when loggin successfully shows the users profile who is loggedin along with the day and time of the system. The authorization restriction is managed with the dynamic use of session where the users
id and name are used that are retrived from the database via GET methods respectively.

8.Another part is the creation of category which generally is the platform of the products that are to be sold such as Playstation or Xbox which later joins the products table respectively.The CRUD operation can be doen
easily with a dynamic and easy to use layout. The authorized users are able to create edit or remove the records from the category table respectively. Inorder to show the use of javascript and ajax, the remove code of the category is done 
using ajax where the data is posted asynchronously with alerts used to track the progress and see which id is being deleted respectively.

9. Similarly, employee or authorized users table is also used where users are able to use CRUD operation to add or edit or delete the users. But the thing is the user who is logged at the current session is not able to delete him/herself.
This feature is added too. Later in the future enhancement we can add the removal of the users only by the admin when the application is made role based with superadmin, admin and employee that makes the application much more
secure. Besides, other crud operations are same which are dynamic and with easy to navigate layout.
 
10. Product can also be added via dashboard area which can be seen in the index main page dynamically. Product CRUD operation is also created similar to other two operations where we can add products according to the category and 
show those in the main page respectively. The front page index.php reflects data that are populated from database which were added from product. link: localhost/playstation.php. As we can see that there are various data with categories such as playstation
or Xbox or nintendo. These are also filtered and in playstation.php only the product with category - PlayStation are shown and the one with Xbox are not shown.

Note:
- In Index.php goto nav bar select the shop dropdown button and goto playstation menu. It will redirect to playstation.php page where the data are populated from product table from database. This only shows the product with playstation category.
- for login the USERNAME: ADMIN and PASSWORD: WWW
-Goto navbar and click Sign-in dropdown button and select login option. It will redirect to login.php page. Use the credentials and login which will reflect to dash.php page which is the admin or employee portal for a CMS site.
-Also check entering the wrong password or username.It will redirect to erro.php. Session is used to authorize the access for only authorized personals. Also without login check the links such as dash.php, employee.php, category.php
 or product.php which will redirect to error page if not logged in
-Inside the dashboard area, all the options are useable where all the menus have their own CRUD(create, read, update and delete) operations. 
-There are few exception in the product part which will be fixed in final assignment such as which updating product if changing name requires to select image again or else it will not be saved in db. Edit part is abit required to fix.
-Data validation is the next target that is set for assignment 3 as well.
